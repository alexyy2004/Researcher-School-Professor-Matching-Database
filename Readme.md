# Researcher-School-Professor-Matching-Database

Our project aims to connect data in the academic world to help aspiring PHD candidates select a university and mentor that best fits their interests. Our projects will parse the research output (papers, studies, experiments, etc) of a number of universities, define a set of topics, and identify a number of experts in those fields. During account creation, users will be able to select the topics they are interested in and we will tune their search output by that. Users can search for specific experts/mentors, and universities. We will output a graph that shows the relationship between different experts in their selected fields and how that is tied to universities. Nodes in this graph will be Experts and Universities while edges will indicate that there can be some collaborative research output by two experts and/or is from a university. Users can select a node to see more information on that person or university.
