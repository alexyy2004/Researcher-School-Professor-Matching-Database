## Project Summary

Our project aims to aggregate the findings of several databases related to criminal activity and present it in a way that makes relationships between different entities or events clear. This application can take the place of pin boards you may see detectives use in investigation to map different objects to each other. An object can be a person, IP address, gang, etc. 
An object can be imported into a board with either a manual entry, or a lookup of a person, event, IP address, etc in one or more publicly accessible databases (facilitated by our application). While importing an object into the board, we will have an algorithm that suggests adding relationships between the new object and objects on the board. The user also has the opportunity to enter relationships between objects on the board. The visual representation will look much like a pinboard used by detectives. Objects will be represented by nodes and relationships by edges. Overlap between seperate boards (investigations) can also be viewed.
